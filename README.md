Other Minds Code and Assets

## Important information
Other Minds was a huge solo project, and a massive learning experience for me. I hadn't programmed in about 11 years so I'd forgotten a lot of things and instead of looking them up, I decided to just roll with it.
This means that the project is, basically, a huge mess.
Due to general bad syntax, this game is no longer buildable in more recent versions of Gamemaker because a lot of things break. This means without a huge overhaul of something like *55,000 lines of code*, the game is no longer maintainable.
But let's not hide it away forever.
